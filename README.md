# Projekt: Write a Data Science Blog Post!
This repository contains the Data Science Project 1 from Udacity.

The project answers the following questions:

Which database environment generated the greatest increase in popularity between 2021 and 2023?

Which medium was the most popular for learning programming between 2021 and 2023?

What was the most used operating system by Stackoverflow users in 2021-2023?

Important note:
Due to the file size, I had to upload all files as a zip file.
You have to download all zip files and unpack them locally in the respective project directory.
You need the following files to run:

Datascience-Project1-SO-Exploration.ipynb
survey_results_schema_21.csv
survey_results_public_21.csv
survey_results_public_22.csv
survey_results_public_23.csv

In order to successfully run the Jupyter Notebook with all its contents, the following files (please check the name and pay attention to the year) must be stored in the project directory:

survey_results_schema_21.csv

survey_results_public_21.csv

survey_results_public_22.csv

survey_results_public_23.csv

The files can also be downloaded directly from Stackoverflow.
