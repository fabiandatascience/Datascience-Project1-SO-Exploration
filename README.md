# Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post

This repository contains the first Data Science project from Udacity, which involves analyzing data from the StackOverflow surveys to uncover insights about developer trends from 2021 to 2023.

## 1. Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

Additionally, you will need Jupyter Notebook to view and execute the provided `.ipynb` file.

## 2. Project Motivation

This project seeks to answer several key questions using the StackOverflow developer surveys from 2021 to 2023:
1. **Which database environment experienced the greatest increase in popularity between 2021 and 2023?**
2. **Which medium was the most popular for learning programming between 2021 and 2023?**
3. **What was the most commonly used operating system among StackOverflow users during this period?**

By exploring these questions, the project aims to provide insights into developer trends and evolving preferences within the programming community.

## 3. File Descriptions

The repository contains the following files:

- `Datascience-Project1-SO-Exploration.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code and analysis for this project.
- `survey_results_schema_21.csv`: StackOverflow 2021 survey schema.
- `survey_results_public_21.csv`: StackOverflow 2021 survey data.
- `survey_results_public_22.csv`: StackOverflow 2022 survey data.
- `survey_results_public_23.csv`: StackOverflow 2023 survey data.

**Important Note:**  
Due to file size limitations, the survey datasets have been uploaded as zip files. You must download and extract these files into the project directory for the notebook to function correctly.

## 4. How to Interact with the Project

1. Download all necessary zip files and extract them into the project directory.
2. Ensure the following files are present in the directory:
    - `survey_results_schema_21.csv`
    - `survey_results_public_21.csv`
    - `survey_results_public_22.csv`
    - `survey_results_public_23.csv`
3. Open the `Datascience-Project1-SO-Exploration.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Execute the cells to view the analysis and results.

Alternatively, you can download the StackOverflow survey datasets directly from the official source:
